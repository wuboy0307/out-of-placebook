I believe it is our responsibility to keep doing our part to build a better, stronger, and fairer future for our country and the world.
The holidays are a time to be thankful for our blessings. So let us rejoice in this season and look forward with renewed hope and determination.
I wish you and your family health, happiness, and continued strength for the New Year and the work ahead. I look forward to staying in touch in 2017. Onward!
With deep appreciation and warm wishes, I am,
Yours,

I learned a lot about the engineering that goes into these cars. Each engine is designed to run at 9,000 RPMs for 700 miles in a single race, and then it's done. It gets up to 140 degrees in the cockpit of the cars, and drivers are in there for up to five hours in a race. They drive an average close to 200mph during these races. That's a bit faster than I go in my GTI."]

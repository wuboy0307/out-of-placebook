Remove RECEIVE_ERRORS from auth_reducer and actions as not currently being used

remove 'hit thunk' from thunk.js

remove window.store from oopbook.jsx

have two-way dependent => destroy on users so that their friendships are removed if profile is deleted.

improve profile show jsob jbuilder to make it not have to fetch child comments again (line 28)

make likes not hit database a load of times. (maybe due to like preview text?)

how to get includes of children as well?

-- TODO FRIDAY:
  - Change comments from array to hash and write appropriate reducer
  - Same for child comments (OR: APPEND?? - actually nvm won't help for edit)
